# Katene's Form Validation Solution

## React

I decided to fix the form using react mainly because I am familar with the tech and I am comfortable with tackling these sorts of issues with react. A limitation to using react over vanilla JS is that there was more code I needed to write but in doing so, I could get more thorough checks and it also allowed me to show errors more dynamically.

## Installation

Enter the commands below in your terminal to get started:
_You might need to delete the yarn.lock file then yarn again_

```
git clone https://github.com/katene30/form-validation-problem.git
cd form-validation-problem
git checkout Katene
yarn
yarn dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the form.

## Browser Support

This web app was built and primarily manually tested on Google Chrome but I've also tested the form on Safari and Firefox. All of which, the validation and functionality works the same.

## Testing

I'm still new to testing but I can recognise points in my code that I would refactor in the future such as splitting the functions into seperate files to make testing easier. As I am still getting my head around testing, I would love pointers to best setup some tests for the validation in the form.

## Tooling

- JS
- React
- react-dom
- Express
- task runner (webpack)
