# Katene's Form Validation Solution

## React

I decided to fix the form using react mainly because I am familar with the tech and I am comfortable with tackling these sorts of issues with react. A limitation to using react over vanilla JS is that there was more code I needed to write but in doing so, I could get more thorough checks and it also allowed me to show errors more dynamically.
